  "product_overview": "The IT Inventory Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform developed for Ananta Companies to efficiently manage IT assets across multiple factory locations including Head Office, AGL, AJL, ABM, and PWPL. It provides centralized asset tracking, maintenance and service management, approval workflows, detailed user roles, and notifications to streamline asset lifecycle management and ensure secure operational control.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Centralized management of IT assets across multiple factories with data segregation and access control.",
    "Implement a robust approval workflow system for critical asset operations like addition, service, and deletion, enhancing accountability and control.",
    "Provide detailed tracking and historical records of asset service and maintenance activities for audit and operational insights.",
    "Ensure secure user management with role-based permissions tailored for super admins, admins, factory users, and general users.",
    "Enable efficient notifications and data export capabilities to inform stakeholders and facilitate reporting."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Multi-factory asset management with dedicated tables for Head Office and each factory (AGL, AJL, ABM, PWPL).",
    "Approval workflow system that manages requests for adding, servicing, completing services, and deleting assets ensuring changes are authorized.",
    "Comprehensive asset lifecycle management including addition, status updates (Active, Inactive, Out of Order, Maintenance), removal with archival, and service history logging.",
    "Role-based dashboards and permissions including Super Admin, Admin, Factory Users, and Regular Users to manage access and operations according to responsibilities.",
    "Real-time notifications system to keep users informed about approval requests, processing results, service completion, and asset status changes.",
    "User management facilities allowing administrators to create, view, and delete system users securely with password hashing.",
    "Data filtering, searching, and export to CSV for asset inventories to support operational efficiency and reporting.",
    "Factory-specific service history and deleted asset archive views for detailed operational traceability."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Factory User logs in and accesses their factory-specific dashboard to view assets and request actions like adding, removing, or servicing assets which generate approval requests.",
    "Admin or Super Admin reviews pending approval requests through a dedicated interface and decides to approve or reject each request, enforcing operational governance.",
    "Upon approval, the system executes the requested actions such as adding assets to inventory, updating asset statuses for service, or archiving deleted assets while notifying relevant users.",
    "Admins can manage the user base by creating, deleting, or viewing users, maintaining system security and operational integrity.",
    "Users receive notifications for approval requests, outcomes, service completions, and asset status updates to stay informed of system activities."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Successful addition of assets either directly by Head Office admins or via approval requests from factory users.",
    "Approval requests for asset add, service, complete service, and delete actions must be captured, reviewed, and processed accurately reflecting the chosen approval status.",
    "Asset status updates correctly reflect in the database and associated service history records maintain accurate tracking information.",
    "User authentication and role-based access control enforce secure login and restrict access to appropriate dashboards and functionalities.",
    "Notifications are generated and delivered for key events including approval submissions, approvals, rejections, and service completions.",
    "API endpoints respond as specified, supporting all CRUD operations on assets, user management, approvals, service history, and notifications.",
    "Data export functionality generates correct CSV files with appropriate data and formats.",
    "Deleted assets are archived with complete removal information and accessible via filtered views per factory."
